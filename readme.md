The Weather Is... is a single page applicaiton that shows the local weather when the use enters a zipcode. The goal was the location to be detected automatically, but that only works when I have a secure web service, which I currently dont. But adding the option to enter a zipcode can help people plan their day better if they work in a different zipcode than they live, or they are traveling over a mountain pass, the user can enter the travel destination zipcode and get the weather along the route.
